                            Local Storage: <br> It is a web storage method that helps store data on the client’s
                            computer in
                            the form of key/value pairs in a web browser. The data is stored in local storage for a
                            lifetime unless the user manually deletes it from the browser. It does not expire even when
                            the user closes the window or tab. Instead, the data remains in the browser until and unless
                            the browser's memory is cleared. <br>
                            Local storage has 4 methods: <br>
                            *setItem() Method – This method takes two parameters one is key and another one is value. It
                            is used to store the value in a particular location with the name of the key. <br>
                            localStorage.setItem(key, value). <br>
                            *getItem() Method – This method takes one parameter that is key which is used to get the
                            value stored with a particular key name. <br>
                            localStorage.getItem(key) . <br>
                            removeItem() Method – This is method is used to remove the value stored in the memory in
                            reference to key. <br>
                            localStorage.removeItem(key) . <br>
                            clear() Method – This method is used to clear all the values stored in localstorage. <br>
                            localStorage.clear(). <br>
                            Session Storage: <br>It is very similar to the local storage. Still, the main difference
                            lies in the lifespan as it persists in the browser until its current tab is on. Once you
                            close the tab or terminate it, the data on session storage also gets lost. We can also set
                            and retrieve its data using setItem() and getItem() methods, respectively, similar to the
                            local storage methods. <br> sessionStorage.setItem(key, value);
                            <br>sessioinStorage.getItem(key);

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Global scope: <br>The Javascript global scope is the context where everything in a
                            Javascript program executes by default. This scope includes all variables, objects, and
                            references that are not contained within a customized scope defined by a programmer.
                            <br>Global scope is the entire Javascript execution environment. Any variables assigned
                            without an explicit scope (using the var, let, or const keywords) automatically become
                            global variables. The same is true for functions. <br>myVar = 1; // An automatic global
                            variable

                            // An automatic global function
                            function myFunc() {
                            return true;
                            }. <br>
                            Local scope: <br>Local Scope occurs when you create a variable inside a function. By doing
                            that, the visibility and accessibility of the variable is only allowed within that
                            function.Any variable created inside the yellow box is a local variable, just like any
                            variable inside blue box is a global one. <br>A local variable is different than a global
                            variable and is more complicated to understand. This demo shows the basic behavior/concept
                            of local scope. If you create different functions, you basically create different scopes for
                            each of them. <br>var globalOne=16;
                            function testingScope(){
                            var localOne=12;
                            console.log(localOne); // 12
                            console.log(globalOne); // 16
                            }
                            testingScope() // 12 and 16
                            console.log(localOne); // Uncaught ReferenceError: localOne is not defined

                        <p class="card-text">Event loop <br>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call
                            Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first
                            event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.

                            ... }) is added to the Call Stack. <br>6.setTimeout(function cb1() { ... }) is executed. The
                            browser creates a timer as part of the Web APIs. It is going to handle the countdown for
                            you. <br>7.The setTimeout(function cb1() { ... }) itself is complete and is removed from the
                            Call Stack. <br>8.console.log('Bye') is added to the Call Stack. <br>9.console.log('Bye') is
                            executed. <br>10.console.log('Bye') is removed from the Call Stack. <br>11.After at least
                            5000 ms, the timer completes and it pushes the cb1 callback to the Callback Queue.
                            <br>12.The Event Loop takes cb1 from the Callback Queue and pushes it to the Call Stack.
                            <br>13.cb1 is executed and adds console.log('cb1') to the Call Stack.
                            <br>14.console.log('cb1') is executed. <br>15.console.log('cb1') is removed from the Call
                            Stack. <br>16.cb1 is removed from the Call Stack.

                            1.A declared variable but not yet assigned with a value (uninitialized) is by default

                            myVariable; // => undefined <br>2.Contrary, a const or let variable cannot be accessed
                            before the declaration line — the variable is in a temporal dead zone before the
                            declaration. And that's nice because you have less chance to access an undefined.
